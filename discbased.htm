            <h2>Final Fantasy 7</h2>
        
        
                    <img class="image" src="images/ff7.jpg" alt="FInal Fantasy 7"/>
        
        
            <p> This was my first experience with a Japanese style RPG video game and I fell in love with it from the firt time I played it. I has all the hallmakrs of why I love JRPGs. Crazy storylines, memorable characters and tons of places to explore.   </p>
           
                
            <h2>Metal Gear Solid</h2>
                    <img class="image" src="images/mgs.jpg" alt="Metal Gear Solid"/>
                    <p> I never reall got in to military style games so this one kinda floored me. It was my exposure to steakth based games where it was essential to NOT be seen. That was a first for me and I ate it up.  This was also the first game that I had ever experienced a fourth wall break where you had to make physical changed to your console set up to progress in the game. I wont spoil it here but it was truly innovative at the time.   </p>
            
            <h2>Tecmo's Deception</h2>       
            
                    <img class="image" src="images/deception.jpg" alt="Tecmo's Deception"/>
            
        
            <p>This game is one of the most unique one's I've ever played.  It flips the narrative and puts you in the role of the "villian" defending your castle against the villagers of a town who perceive you to be evil. The only tools at your defense are traps you set througout your castle. I really enjoyed how this game deals with perceptions of good and evil.  Not what I expected at all and it makes the game better for it.  </p>
