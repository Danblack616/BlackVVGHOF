            <h2>Super Mario Brothers 3</h2>
        
        
                    <img class="image" src="images/smb3.jpg" alt="SMB3"/>
        
        
            <p> Although this is the Third entry in the series this is by far my favorite Mario game. It added some of the most popular features of the series. The stand out to me was the addition of the different power up suits you could find that would grant you abilities such as limited flight and being able to swim underwearted with ease.  </p>
            
            
                
             <h2>RC Pro AM</h2>
      
                    <img class="image" src="images/rcproam.jpg" alt="RCProAM"/>
            
        
            <p>This one might suprise most folks but I absolutely adore this game and still play it frequently to this day. It has that just one more game feeling when you get that game over screen. It has simple but very addicting gameplay. The title screen music is so instantly catching I still find myself whistling it to this day.  </p>
            
            <h2> Legend of Zelda</h2>
            
           
        
                    <img class="image" src="images/zelda.jpg" alt="Legend of Zelda"/>
            
        
            <p>Out of all these games this is the one I probably spent the most time on. I love the sense of exploration and freedom in this one. My friends and I put so much time and effort exploring every nook and cranny in this game as there were tons of hidden items to find. Since this came out long before the internet was a thing exploring was really the only way to find them , and we all loved the hunt.  </p>
